* Quotes from Abundant Community book
There is a hollowness in an obsession with winning. This obsession is why
sports are so pervasive as a metaphor in business. Cooperative or aesthetic
pursuits would not  justify the sacrifice we make for the system world. So much
for art and nature.

Forgiveness is required when we have to live together.

The community can play an important role in rearing children and helping them to
learn about their own abilities and what it means to be a contributing member of
society:
  - Have young people teach the Internet to seniors and adults.
  - Hold gatherings where youth learn about music , painting , poetry , storytelling , and dance from artistic neighbors.
  - Create a tutor list so that young people can learn what the neighbors know.
  - Make an inventory of each neighbor’s job , and then connect our teens to people with interesting jobs so that they can learn what the neighbors do and how to prepare for a vocation.
  - Have a children’s clothes exchange.
  - Have rewards for older children tutoring younger children.
  - Have monthly potluck dinners where we sing together and urge our children to share their talent with the adults.

Here are some ways that neighborhood gifts can help us care for the land: 
  - Bring broken things together to be repaired instead of making more waste.
  - Have neighborhood hikes. Create neighborhood gardens. Join community - supported agriculture.
  - Have a forum where people learn about buying local food and food security.
  - Share transportation to work. Carpool with neighbors to schools , activities.
  - Only buy things with no packaging. 

There are many things to do to support a local economy and economic self - sufficiency:
  - Help repair a neighbor’s house.
  - A modern barn raising. 
  - On the neighborhood website bulletin board , neighbors can post job openings
    in their workplaces.
  - Identify the neighborhood entrepreneurs and convene them to share insights.
    They can offer advice to neighbors who want to start a business.
  - Identify home businesses , and publicize and patronize them. At a
    neighborhood forum , invite local businesspeople to make  presentations,
    and then develop a neighborhood compact to support the local businesses as
    well as new entrepreneurs from the neighborhood. 
  - At another forum, have neighborhood professionals , nurses , teachers ,
    contractors inform us about
    what we need to know to “ decode ” their trades. 
  - Create a barter exchange where people can offer and receive skills such as
    haircutting , paperhanging , and minor electrical work. This is done with
    the belief that it will even out in the end. 
  - We can buy and eat locally produced and marketed food. 

To provide more security , care , and health in the neighborhood , we can do the
following: 
  - Create mutual support groups for single parents , bereaved neighbors ,
    parents of teenagers , and people in other situations where the wisdom of
    common experience can help us make our way. 
  - Hold a forum on neighborhood security to get eyes on the street. Agree on
    who can pay attention at what times. Include a way of reporting on what
    police activity is in the neighborhood. 
  - Learn from peacemakers how to ease family and neighborhood quarrels. 
  - Have a forum to help us get organized and ask those who are home a lot to
    tell us what is happening. 
  - Connect child care with the elderly and retired. Find ways that children and
    the elderly can support each other and be less lonely. 
  - Help the mothers get some rest. 
  - Have a health exchange where people talk about what is working to stay
    healthy and deal with the aches and pains of life
